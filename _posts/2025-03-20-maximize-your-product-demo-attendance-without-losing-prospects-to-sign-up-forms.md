# Stop Losing Qualified Buyers Before Your Product Demo Even Starts

Are you a passionate sales manager or product consultant whose weekly live product demonstration sessions are crucial for closing deals? You pour hours into perfecting that presentation, but the actual **product demo attendance rate** feels like a revolving door. You watch your conversion funnel leak prospects right at the sign-up gate because they balk at creating yet another account or downloading a new app just to see your software in action. This friction is costing you valuable sales pipeline every single week.

## The Hidden Cost of Mandatory Registrations for Your Live Sessions

You know your software solves a massive problem for your ideal client, but getting them to the live session is the first major hurdle. The frustration is real: you send out the polished invitation, and the response is lukewarm. Why? Because standard event tools force potential customers through a multi-step registration wall—name, email, password creation, confirmation email click—all before they even know if your demo is worth their time. This complexity breeds **registration abandonment**. It feels unprofessional when prospects have to jump through hoops just to attend a crucial sales presentation, eroding the very trust you aim to build. Your focus should be on showcasing your **marketing automation software**, not fighting outdated sign-up processes.
