# Stop Chasing RSVPs- How Local Business Stammtisch Events Thrive with [ijoin.app](https://ijoin.app/index-en.html)

Are you tired of the low RSVP rates that plague your monthly **local business Stammtisch**? You want to foster a strong, connected community of entrepreneurs, but getting them to commit to a date feels like pulling teeth. Every organizer understands the frustration of planning a vital **business networking** event, only to have half the attendees forget to reply or drop out at the last minute.

## The Hidden Drain on Your Networking Energy

You dedicate time and effort to curating valuable **Stammtisch** meetings—securing a great location, setting the agenda, and ensuring the content is relevant for local commerce. But the logistics of managing attendance often overshadow the main event.

The core problem is friction. You’re forced to choose between cumbersome email chains, privacy-violating group chats, or complex event platforms that demand attendees create yet *another* login. When busy local business owners see a barrier—a required registration, an app download, or a password reset—they simply close the window.

This friction doesn't just lower your attendance; it erodes the perception of your organization. It suggests that joining your community is complicated, when it should be the simplest decision they make all month. If your **business networking** event is hard to join, how valuable can it be?
