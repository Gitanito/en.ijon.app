# Stop Losing RSVPs for Your Dog Playdates and Meetups

Are you tired of sending out invites for your dog playdate or neighborhood pack walk only to have half the replies get lost in text threads or forgotten emails? You want a full house—happy dogs, relaxed owners—but the friction of asking people to sign up, download an app, or even remember a password is silently killing your attendance numbers. **Getting an accurate headcount shouldn't feel like training a puppy to sit on command.**

## The Hidden Barrier Killing Your Attendance Rate

You put real effort into organizing the perfect park session or backyard romp. You pick the best time, you scout the location, and you send out the invitations. But then the confusion starts. "Wait, where do I RSVP again?" "Oh, I forgot my login for that system." Suddenly, you’re chasing down confirmations, manually tracking plus-ones, and you have no idea if you should bring three bags of treats or ten. **This administrative headache makes you dread organizing anything.** It feels unfair that a simple social gathering is bogged down by unnecessary digital hurdles. You deserve a simple way to know exactly who is coming, and your friends deserve an easy way to say yes.

## The Joy of Knowing Exactly Who’s Coming

## Don't Let Digital Hurdles Keep Your Pack Apart

If you stick with outdated invitation methods, you are guaranteeing that a percentage of interested attendees will simply drop off before they even confirm.
