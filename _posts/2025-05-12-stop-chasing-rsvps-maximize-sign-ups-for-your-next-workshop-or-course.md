# Stop Chasing RSVPs - Maximize Sign-Ups for Your Next Workshop or Course

Are you tired of losing potential attendees because your **event registration** process is too complicated? As a creator or small business owner, your focus should be on teaching your craft—like that fantastic **Töpferkurs für Anfänger**—not wrestling with clunky sign-up forms that demand logins and passwords. You need a frictionless way to convert interest into commitment, dramatically increasing your **course sign-up** rates.

## The Frustration of the Friction-Filled Form

You’ve poured your heart into creating the perfect workshop, whether it’s a pottery class, a digital marketing seminar, or a local meet-up. You post a beautiful announcement on Instagram or send out an exciting email. Then comes the inevitable drop-off.

Why does this happen? Because traditional **event registration** systems are designed for the platform, not the user. They force your potential attendees to create an account, download an app, or navigate a confusing multi-step form just to say, "Yes, I want to come!"

This friction is the silent killer of your enrollment numbers. It makes people feel like the sign-up process is a bigger commitment than the course itself. It's frustrating for you because you know people want to join, but they are blocked by unnecessary hurdles. You deserve a tool that respects both your time and your attendees' willingness to join your next **Töpferkurs für Anfänger**.
