# Stop Chasing RSVP's - Get Instant Dev Commitments for Your Next Session

You have the brilliant idea, the motivated team, and the perfect project scope for a weekend hackathon. You need a frictionless way to coordinate participants, track equipment needs, and ensure everyone stays updated—especially when plans shift last minute. **Coordinating a hackathon or a coding session** should be about building, not battling spreadsheets and confusing email chains.

This is where the magic of effortless event coordination comes in, boosting your **participant registration** rates immediately.

## The Frustration of Fragmented Group Coordination

You send out the invitation. Then the chaos begins.

You’re tracking responses across email, Slack, and WhatsApp. Half your potential participants love the idea but hate the friction of creating yet another account or downloading a new app just to say "Yes." You need to know who's coming, who's bringing the power strips, and if the venue changed from the coffee shop to the co-working space.

Worse, you spend hours manually compiling a list, only to have someone miss the critical update about the new start time. This friction doesn't just waste your time; it actively lowers your **hackathon attendance**. When the barrier to entry is high—even just a simple login—busy developers will drop off, and your event suffers. You need a system that respects their time and minimizes administrative overhead.
